please add these tables via mySQL Workbench and make sure your terminal mysql is running
make sure your username is root and your password matches on line 18 in api/app.js

create userDB (user data base) with this command in mysql:

CREATE DATABASE userDB;


create users table, with 2 columns called username and password:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    username varchar(45) NOT NULL,
    password varchar(45) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (useername)
);

that's it. express will attach to your mysql terminal
